# PrayMate - Mobile & Desktop App For Muslims To Manage Their Salah And Goals

<h3> We use this to update the desktop app kind of... 😅 <br> <br> Well you see, the only thing this is, is a plain index.html with the latest version for our desktop app. We update the version here whenever we add changes to the application ⬇️. <br> <br> So, when the app is opened, it sends a request to the site to get its html (which is only the version) and if it is the same, then that means the user has the latest version of the app and if it doesn't we give a popup telling them they can update the application 🧠✅.
