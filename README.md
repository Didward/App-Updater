<h1> What is this page for if there is no code? </h1>
<h3> Well, this repository just holds the versions for the desktop and mobile apps. There should be 2 separate websites with just the version. Every time the user opens the app, we send a request to our website to get the version from the website and check if it is the same, if it is then we don't do anything but if it's different then we tell the user that they can update the app. </h3>
